## C implementation of Common Data Structures ans Algorithms

This is a project in which I have implemented a few algorithms and data structures in C.
The implementation is based on the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas Cormen, Rivest and Leiserson

This project is a learning exercise, with focus on getting comfortable with common data structures and algorithm techniques like dynamic programming.
Feel free to fork this repository and improve upon my code.
